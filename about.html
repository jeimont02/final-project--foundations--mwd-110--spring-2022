During this time, Disney also enrolled in a class at the  Art Institute of Chicago. He graduated from school at the age of 16 and volunteered during World War I after changing his birth certificate to list his  birth certificate as 1900 so that he could be enrolled in the Red Cross.

 Disney returned to the USA, moved to Kansas City and, with Ub Iwerks, formed a company called "IwerksDisney Commercial Artists" in January 1920. The company faltered and Disney and Iwerks soon gained employment at the Kansas City Film Ad Corporation, working on primitive animated advertisements for local movie houses.

 In 1921, Disney started LaughOgrams, Inc., which produced short cartoons based on popular fairy tales and children`s stories. Among his employees were Iwerks, Hugh Harman, Rudolf Ising, Carman Maxwell, and Friz Freleng. The shorts were popular in the local Kansas City area, but their costs exceeded their returns. After making the last short film, live-action / animated Alice's Wonderland, the studio filed for bankruptcy in July 1923. Two of Disney's brothers, Roy Oliver Disney and Raymond Arnold Disney, were hired as bankers at First National Bank in downtown Kansas City while Walt was developing a studio at Laugh Ograms, Inc.  Roy later invited Walt to move to Hollywood, California, and Disney earned enough money to ticket a one-way train  to California and left staff behind, but played the role of Alice's Wonderland.
